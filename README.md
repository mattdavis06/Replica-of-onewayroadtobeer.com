This is my first proper app that I've built using HTML, CSS, JS and my first ever commit to GitHub.

It's a little tribute app to:
onewayroadtobeer.com

I thought this app was a really cool, simple and fun design. I wanted to see if it as possible to emulate, in my early coding journey. I've added and changed a few little things, so it wasn't exactly the same and I'll look to try and add to it further in the future.

After a very long year of COVID-19 and into our third lockdown in the UK. This app made me smile and something to view from time to time, as we all moved ever closer to that first cold pint with friends! 

Thanks to the people at onewayroadtobeer.com for making it.

Make sure you check out their original site, donate and buy them a drink!
